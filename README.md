# BG3 Monk Wanderer Subclass
A homebrew monk subclass that is something like a cross between historical shinobi and yamabushi. 

Said another way, it's like a "ranger monk" or "druid monk." 


I made the Wanderer because I wanted a monk subclass with a more nature-oriented flavor. 

It currently uses the old icon for the Samurai subclass (Bonnaventura) as a placeholder. 

The initial build was made using Way of the Kensei (YuukaYunna) as the initial template.

It should be operational if you want to take it for a spin, but there are janky bits with icons and sound/animation combos that I'm not satisfied with. I'll be adjusting them as I do a run with it.

I tried to make it balanced, and since I can't decide if it's underpowered or overpowered, I think it's about right. 

While the subclass gets a lot of tricks, most of them are RP-based/mechanically underwhelming.
