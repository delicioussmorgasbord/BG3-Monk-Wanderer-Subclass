# BG3 Monk Wanderer Subclass (WIP)
A homebrew monk subclass that is something like a cross between historical shinobi and yamabushi. Said another way, it's like a 'ranger monk' or 'druid monk.' It currently uses the old icon for the Samurai subclass (Bonnaventura) as a placeholder. The initial build was made using Way of the Kensei (YuukaYunna) as the initial template.

I made the Wanderer because I wanted a monk subclass with an animistic/esoteric flavor. I find it more fun to play characters with lots of weak but situationally useful RP abilities; while the Wanderer gets a lot of techniques, the subclass is *very* ki-hungry, and none of the techniques are particularly strong on their own.

It should be operational if you want to take it for a spin, but there are janky bits with icons and sound/animation combos that I'm not satisfied with. I'll be adjusting them as I do a run with it. That said, as long as it's only on here and not on Nexus, assume that means that it's not "release-ready".

I recommend making characters with this subclass into the party's chief item user – scrolls, grenades, wands, etc. – since it is much more control-oriented in combat than the base 3 subclasses. I tried to make it balanced, and since I can't decide if it's underpowered or overpowered, I think it should at least be within the realm of reason.

OVERVIEW (note: pre-release, I'm using this overview for review and balancing, so there will be minor differences with the current version)

WAY OF THE WANDERER

"You use your ki to enhance your senses and blur the boundaries between yourself, the world, and others."

Moonsight: You have learned to subconsciously circulate your ki to boost your senses, imparting you with permanent superior darkvision.

Mosswalker: For 4 Ki, you can weave ki into your immediate surroundings, subtly warping the perception of outside observers. You gain a +10 bonus to Stealth checks and cause enemies to have Disadvantage in attack rolls against you. Requires Concentration.

Beguiling Persona: Use 1 Ki to help guide your expressions and mannerisms towards a creature, giving you Advantage on all Charisma checks with them. This technique is not considered a spell and never provokes hostility.

Projection: For 1 Ki, project your ki a short distance away, creating a sensory effect that compels nearby creatures to investigate, like the cantrip Minor Illusion.
