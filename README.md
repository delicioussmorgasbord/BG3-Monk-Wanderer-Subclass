# BG3 Monk Wanderer Subclass
 A homebrew monk subclass that is something like a cross between historical shinobi and yamabushi. Said another way, a "ranger monk" or "druid monk." I made this because I wanted a monk subclass with a more nature-oriented flavor. Currently uses old Samurai subclass (Bonnaventura) icon as a placeholder. Built using Way of the Kensei (YuukaYunna) as initial template.
