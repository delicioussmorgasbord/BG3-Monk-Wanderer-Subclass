# BG3 Monk Wanderer Subclass (WIP)
A homebrew monk subclass that is something like a cross between historical shinobi and yamabushi. Said another way, it's like a 'ranger monk' or 'druid monk.' It currently uses the old icon for the Samurai subclass (Bonnaventura) as a placeholder. The initial build was made using Way of the Kensei (YuukaYunna) as the initial template.

I made the Wanderer because I wanted a monk subclass with an animistic/esoteric flavor. It should be operational if you want to take it for a spin, but there are janky bits with icons and sound/animation combos that I'm not satisfied with. I'll be adjusting them as I do a run with it. That said, as long as it's only on here and not on Nexus, assume that means that it's not "release-ready".

I recommend making characters with this subclass into the party's chief item user – scrolls, grenades, wands, etc. – since it is much more control-oriented in combat than the base 3 subclasses. I tried to make it balanced, and since I can't decide if it's underpowered or overpowered, I think it should at least be within the realm of reason.

OVERVIEW (planned - right now the progression in the mod is different for testing, but these are the subclass features)

WAY OF THE WANDERER

"You use your ki to enhance your senses and blur the boundaries between yourself, the world, and others."

LEVEL 3

PASSIVES

Wilderness Ascetic: Select proficiency in either the Nature or Survival skill.

Precision Throwing: You throw with considerable finesse and can use your Dexterity modifier instead of Strength modifier for to-hit attack rolls when throwing objects.

ACTIONS

Recall Austerities: Use a standard action to mentally revisit your harsh training in extreme environments, steeling yourself. You receive a 1d4 bonus on saving throws for the next 5 turns.

Sentience Link: Use 4 Ki to create a long-lasting mental link with all sentient creatures, enabling communication with animals and reading the thoughts of more intelligent beings until your next Long Rest.

Calm Creature: Use 3 Ki to placate a sentient creature (animal, plant, monster, humanoid) for 10 rounds. When used on an ally, behaves like the spell Calm Emotions. May provoke hostility once the effect fades.

Pounce: Use your bonus action and 1 Ki to focus ki into your legs, tripling your jumping distance for 10 rounds.

___

LEVEL 5

PASSIVES

Moonsight: You have learned to subconsciously circulate your ki to boost your senses, imparting you with permanent superior darkvision.

ACTIONS

Mosswalker: For 3 Ki, you can weave ki into your immediate surroundings, subtly warping the perception of outside observers. You gain a +10 bonus to Stealth checks and cause enemies to have Disadvantage in attack rolls against you until your next rest (Short or Long). Requires Concentration.

Beguiling Persona: Use 1 Ki to help guide your expressions and mannerisms towards a creature, giving you Advantage on all Charisma checks with them. This technique is not considered a spell and never provokes hostility.

Projection: For 1 Ki, project your ki a short distance away, creating a sensory effect that compels nearby creatures to investigate, like the cantrip Minor Illusion.

___

LEVEL 7

PASSIVES

(Ki Circulation: Whenever you prematurely cancel an ongoing effect that required Ki Points to use, regain half of the points used for it, rounded down. This must be a willed action and does not occur if Concentration is forcibly broken or the effect ends due to being incapacitated) PLANNED

ACTIONS

Hagakure: Use 1 Ki to suppress your presence, immediately becoming Invisible if you are obscured. 

Shifting Presence: Use 2 Ki to change all aspects of your appearance until your next rest (Short or Long).

Sense Vitals: Use 5 Ki to sense the weak points of a target, dealing an additional 1d6 points of Physical damage whenever you hit it with a weapon attack. If the target dies before the spell ends, you can use Reapply Sense Vitals to mark a new creature. This lasts until your next rest (Short or Long). Requires Concentration.

___

LEVEL 9

PASSIVES

Blindsight: You can now perceive your environs normally in all forms of darkness – including magical darkness and blindness.

ACTIONS

Discerning Senses: For 5 Ki, dramatically enhance your awareness until your next rest (Long or Short), giving you Advantage on Perception, Insight, and Survival checks, making you immune to being Surprised, and enabling you to perceive Invisible entities. Requires Concentration.

Hypnotic Pattern: Use 4 Ki to mesmerize creatures that can see you for two rounds.

Vital Overflow: Use 4 Ki to flood nearby plants with vital energy and cause them to grow rapidly, quartering the movement of those who pass through them.

___

LEVEL 11

PASSIVES

(Greater Focus: You can maintain two techniques that require Concentration simultaneously. However, both techniques are interrupted if your Concentration is broken.) PLANNED

ACTIONS

Mistrider: Use 2 Ki to 'walk' through lapping folds of natural energy in your immediate environment, teleporting to a location within sight.
